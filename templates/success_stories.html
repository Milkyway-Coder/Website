                    <p>We connected on SoulMate in January 2021. After chatting for a few weeks, we decided to meet for coffee. The connection was instant and we both knew this was something special.</p>
                    <p>What we loved about SoulMate was how the matching algorithm really understood our values and preferences. We had so much in common from the start, which made our relationship flow naturally.</p>
                    <p>After dating for a year, Rahul proposed during a sunset beach walk, and we got married in June 2022. We're so grateful to SoulMate for bringing us together!</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Married March 2023</p>
                    <p>Our story began when Arjun sent me an interest on SoulMate. I was initially hesitant about online matrimony, but his thoughtful first message caught my attention.</p>
                    <p>We started talking and discovered we had the same values, goals, and even similar childhood memories. After a month of conversations, we met with our families, and everything just clicked.</p>
                    <p>Six months later, we were engaged, and we got married in a beautiful ceremony surrounded by our loved ones. SoulMate's detailed profiles helped us find exactly what we were looking for in a partner.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Engaged December 2022</p>
                    <p>I had been on several matrimony sites without success when a friend recommended SoulMate. Within a week, I matched with Vikram, and we instantly connected over our shared love for travel and photography.</p>
                    <p>After three months of video calls (we lived in different cities), Vikram flew to meet me and my family. It felt like we'd known each other for years. The detailed preferences on SoulMate really helped us find someone who matched our lifestyle and values.</p>
                    <p>Vikram proposed during a surprise trip to the mountains, and we're getting married next month! We're so excited to start our life together.</p>
